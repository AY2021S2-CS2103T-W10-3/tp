## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/timeforwheels/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/timeforwheels/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/timeforwheels/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/timeforwheels/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/timeforwheels/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `TimeforWheelsParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a customer).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 3")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 3` Command](images/DeleteDeliveryTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/timeforwheels/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.timeforwheels.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Delete Feature `delete`

The delete feature allows drivers to delete a delivery task from the delivery list by using the index in the displayed list.

Implementation 
The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact when a user enters `delete 3` to delete a delivery tasks with task number 3 in the delivery list:


**Description:**

* When the user keys in the input 'delete 3', execute method of LogicManager is called with the input as the parameter.
* In the method, LogicManager calls the parseCommand method of DeliveryListParser to parse the user input.
* The DeliveryListParser parses the input and identifies it as a DeleteCommand and instantiates a DeleteCommandParser object.
* DeliveryListParser then calls the parse method of the DeleteCommandParser object to further parse the arguments provided.
* In the parse method, the DeleteCommandParser ensures that the input is of the correct format and identifies the index of the customer to be deleted.
* If the index specified by the user is valid, a new DeleteCommand instance is created and returned to LogicManager via DeliveryListParser.
* The LogicManager will then call the overridden execute method of the DeleteCommand object with Model as the argument.
* Subsequently, the DeleteCommand object will invoke deleteCustomer method of Model with the index of the customer to be deleted as the argument.
* It will then return a CommandResult object to LogicManager. This CommandResult will be returned at the end by LogicManager.

The following Activity Diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `delete` command:

![Delete Command Sequence Diagram](images/DeleteDeliveryTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

![Delete Command Activity Diagram](images/DeleteDeliveryTaskActivityDiagram.png)

**Design consideration**:

**Aspect: How `Delete` delivery task executes**

**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Delete delivery task based on the index number shown on the delivery list.

**Pros:** User can ensure that the correct delivery tasks is deleted as index number is unique to each delivery task

**Cons:** User is required to look through the list first to find the index of the delivery tasks they wish to delete

**Alternative 2:** Delete delivery task using name

**Pros**: User may no longer need to look through the delivery list to find the index number of the task they wish to delete

**Cons:** If there are duplicates in the name, the wrong delivery task might get deleted. Furthemore, the User has to type a longer command text if the name is long.

Hence, Alternative 1 was chosen because it is less likely to be buggy when in production even though for a larger delivery list, the user may dislike deleting delivery task based on index

### Edit Feature `edit`

The edit feature allows drivers to edit the name, address, email, tag and date of a delivery task from the delivery list using the index/task number of the delivery task

Implementation 
The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact when a user enters `edit 1 n/Jacob` to change the name of the first delivery task in the delivery list:


**Description:**

* When the user keys in the input `edit 1 n/Jacob`, execute method of LogicManager is called with the input as the parameter.
* In the method, LogicManager calls the parseCommand method of DeliveryListParser to parse the user input.
* The DeliveryListParser parses the input and identifies it as a EditCommand and instantiates a EditCommandParser object.
* DeliveryListParser then calls the parse method of the EditCommandParser object to further parse the arguments provided.
* In the parse method, the EditCommandParser ensures that the input is of the correct format and identifies the index of the item to be edited.
* If both the index and attributes specified by the user is valid, a new EditCommand instance will be created and returned to LogicManager via DeliveryListParser.
* The LogicManager will then call the overridden execute method of the EditCommand object with Model as the argument.
* EditCommand calls the getFilteredCustomerList method of Model to get the customer list. It also calls the createEditedCustomer method to create an edited customer.
* Using the index attribute of the EditCommand object, the customer to be edited from the customer list is retrieved and set to the edited customer.
* Then, EditCommand will create a CommandResult object and return it to LogicManager.
* This CommandResult will be returned at the end by LogicManager.

The following Activity Diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `edit` command:

![Delete Command Sequence Diagram](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)

![Delete Command Activity Diagram](images/EditActivityDiagram.png)

**Design consideration**:

**Aspect: How `edit` delivery task executes**

**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Edit delivery task based on the index number shown on the delivery list.

**Pros:** User can ensure that the correct delivery tasks is edit as index number is unique to each delivery task

**Cons:** User is required to look through the list first to find the index of the delivery tasks they wish to edit

**Alternative 2:** edit delivery task using name

**Pros**: User may no longer need to look through the delivery list to find the index number of the task they wish to edit

**Cons:** If the name is required to be edited, may need to create another new command to edit the name of the delivey task which increase the number of code and testing

Hence, Alternative 1 was chosen because it has less resources for implementation

### Find Feature - `find KEYWORDS`

The find feature allows drivers to find a delivery based on attributes that match the keywords that have been typed in.

Implementation
The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact when a user enters find Alex to retrieve entries matching the word ALex in the delivery list:

![Find Command Sequence Diagram](images/FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

Below is a further breakdown of the logic component of the find command using a sequence diagram

![Find Command Logic Sequence Diagram](images/FindCommandLogicSequenceDiagram.png)

Description:
When the user keys in an input, execute method of LogicManager is called with the user input as the parameter. In the
method, LogicManager calls on the parseCommand method of DeliveryListParser to parse the user input. The
DeliveryListParser parses the user input and identifies it as a FindCommand and instantiates a FindCommandParser object.
DeliveryistParser then invokes the parse method of the FindCommandParser object to further parse the arguments provided.
In the parse method, the FindCommandParser ensures that the input is of the correct format and identifies the keywords.
If the input specified by the user is valid, a new FindCommand instance will be created and returned to LogicManager via
DeliveryListParser. The LogicManager will then invoke the overridden execute method of the FindCommand object with Model
as the argument. Subsequently, the FindCommand object will take in the keywords and invoke the updateFilteredCustomersList method of Model that gets the
entries with attributes that match the keyword(s). It will then return a CommandResult object to LogicManager. This
CommandResult will be returned at the end by LogicManager.

The following Activity Diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the find command:

![Find Command Activity Diagram](images/FindCommandActivityDiagram.png)

**Design consideration**:

**Aspect: How `Find` delivery task command executes**

**Alternative**: Find delivery tasks based on the incomplete keywords.

**Pros:** Wider range of delivery tasks could be retrieved.

**Cons:** Too many results, which may defeat the purposes of reducing the number of entries to go through.

### Remark Command - `remark INDEX r/DESCRIPTION`

The remark command allows the drivers to add any additional information to the delivery task

Below is a sequence diagram for the remark command.

![Remark Command Sequence Diagram](images/RemarkCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

Description:
When the user keys in an input, execute method of LogicManager is called with the user input as the parameter. In the
method, LogicManager calls on the parseCommand method of DeliveryListParser to parse the user input. The
DeliveryListParser parses the user input and identifies it as a RemarkCommand and instantiates a RemarkCommandParser
object. DeliveryListParser then invokes the parse method of the RemarkCommandParser object to further parse the
arguments provided. In the parse method, the RemarkCommandParser ensures that the input is of the correct format and
identifies the input for the index of the item for which remark needs to be added. If the index specified by the user is
valid, a new RemarkCommand instance will be created and returned to LogicManager via DeliveryListParser. The
LogicManager will then invoke the overridden execute method of the RemarkCommand object with Model as the argument.
Subsequently, the RemarkCommand object will be created with the index of the item to add remark, and remark description
as the argument and it will invoke the setCustomer method to replace old entry with the new one which contains the
remark. It will then return a CommandResult object to LogicManager. This CommandResult will be returned at the end by
LogicManager.

Below is an activity diagram for the remark command.

![Remark Command Activity Diagram](images/RemarkCommandActivityDiagram.png)

**Design consideration**:

**Aspect: How `Remark` delivery task command executes**

**Alternative**: Incorporate a Delivery Description field to remark to only store info on items being delivered.

**Pros:** Adds a further critetria to the delivery task.

**Cons:** Reduce flexibility of remark command.

### List Command - `list`
The list command allows users to see all the delivery tasks in the delivery list.

![List Command Sequence Diagram](images/ListCommandLogicSequenceDiagram.png)

Description:
When the user keys the input command "list", execute method of LogicManager is called. In the
method, LogicManager calls on the parseCommand method of DeliveryListParser to parse the command. The
DeliveryListParser parses the command and identifies it as a ListCommand which then returns the CommandResult object 
to the LogicManager. The CommandResult will update the model through the command updatedFilteredCustomerList() to show
all the delivery tasks in the delivery list.

The following Activity Diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the list command:

![List Command Activity Diagram](images/ListCommandActivityDiagram.png)

### Help Command - `help`
The help command allows users to see all the available commands and how to use them

![Help Command Sequence Diagram](images/HelpCommandLogicSequenceDiagram.png)

Description:
When the user keys the input command "help", execute method of LogicManager is called. In the
method, LogicManager calls on the parseCommand method of DeliveryListParser to parse the command. The
DeliveryListParser parses the command and identifies it as a HelpCommand which then returns the CommandResult object
to the LogicManager. The CommandResult will update the UI by setting showHelp() to true to show
the pop-up help window.

The following Activity Diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the list command:

![Help Command Activity Diagram](images/HelpCommandActivityDiagram.png)


### Completed Command - `completed`
The completed command allows users to see all the delivery tasks marked as done.

![Completed Command Sequence Diagram](images/CompletedCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

Below is a further breakdown of the logic component of the completed command using a sequence diagram

![Completed Command Logic Sequence Diagram](images/CompletedCommandLogicSequenceDiagram.png)

Description:
When the user keys the input command "completed", execute method of LogicManager is called. In the
method, LogicManager calls on the parseCommand method of DeliveryListParser to parse the command. The
DeliveryListParser parses the command and identifies it as a CompletedCommand which then returns the CommandResult object
to the LogicManager. The CommandResult will update the model through the command updatedFilteredCustomerList() to show
all the delivery tasks marked done in the delivery list.

The following Activity Diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the completed command:

![Completed Command Activity Diagram](images/CompletedCommandActivityDiagram.png)


### Uncompleted Command - `uncompleted`
The uncompleted command allows users to see all the delivery tasks not marked as done.

![Completed Command Sequence Diagram](images/CompletedCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

Below is a further breakdown of the logic component of the completed command using a sequence diagram

![Completed Command Logic Sequence Diagram](images/CompletedCommandLogicSequenceDiagram.png)

Description:
When the user keys the input command "uncompleted", execute method of LogicManager is called. In the
method, LogicManager calls on the parseCommand method of DeliveryListParser to parse the command. The
DeliveryListParser parses the command and identifies it as a UncompletedCommand which then returns the CommandResult object
to the LogicManager. The CommandResult will update the model through the command updatedFilteredCustomerList() to show
all the delivery tasks not marked done in the delivery list.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Usability**:
    - Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
    - A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.

2. **Reliability**:
    - Should be able to hold up to 1000 delivery entries and display all data if requested by the user in less than 5 seconds.
    - Should be able to detect and inform users of duplicate delivery entries.

3. **Security:**
    - Users that request for any delivery entry data to be deleted will have the data permanently erased from memory.

4. **Integrity**
    - For any time-related data presented to the user, the date formats will be `YYYY-MM-DD`.
    - Delivery entries made by the user will be stored in a _JSON_ file inside the hard disks.

5. **Flexibility**
    - TimeforWheels should be able to make it easy for users to find the delivery information stored inside such as name, date, address, tags etc.
