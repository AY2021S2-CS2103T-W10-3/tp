## Project: TimeForWheels

TimeForWheels is a delivery task management app for delivery drivers 
to manage and track their own workflow. It is optimized for use via 
a Command Line Interface while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface(GUI). 
Overall, TimeForWheels aims to be your perfect delivery companion by improving productivity and simplifying the delivery planning process.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
  
* **New Feature**: Added the ability for drivers to mark delivery tasks as done. (PR [\#59](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/59)) (PR [\#20](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/20))

  * What it does: allows the user to mark a delivery task as done with [âœ“] or not done with [X].
  
  * Justification: This is a core feature of the product as drivers will be able to keep track of tasks completed.
                   Furthermore, the done marking is also used in future commands such as sort, completed and statistics.  
  
* **New Feature**: Added the ability for drivers to view a statistic report of their current workflow to better track and plan their schedule. (PR [\#52](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/52)) (PR[\#109](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/109))

  * What it does: allows the user to generate a summary report of their delivery tasks containing calculations of tasks done/not done, due/not due and tasks with
   fragile, liquid, food, hot, cold, heavy, bulky, urgent tags
   
  * Justification: This is a core feature of the product as it allows drivers to better track and plan their schedule, which is a key goal of our product
  
* **New Feature**: Added the ability for drivers to add remarks to their delivery tasks. (PR [\#2]( https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/2))

  * What it does: allows the user to add miscellaneous statements to their delivery tasks to serve as notes or reminders.
  
  * Justification: This is a core feature of the product as drivers can use remarks to add important notes such as a special request from the customer, person of contact and items being delivered etc
