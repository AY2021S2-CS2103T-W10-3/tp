## Project: TimeForWheels

TimeForWheels is a delivery task management app for delivery drivers
to manage and track their own workflow. It is optimized for use via
a Command Line Interface while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface(GUI).
Overall, TimeForWheels aims to be your perfect delivery companion by improving productivity and simplifying the 
delivery planning process.
