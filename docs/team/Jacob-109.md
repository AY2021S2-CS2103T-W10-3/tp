## Project: TimeForWheels

TimeForWheels is a delivery task management app for delivery drivers
to manage and track their own workflow. It is optimized for use via
a Command Line Interface while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface(GUI).
Overall, TimeForWheels aims to be your perfect delivery companion by improving productivity and simplifying the 
delivery planning process.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability for drivers to get the list of completed deliveries. (PR [\#50]( https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/50))
   * What it does: allows the user to filter the delivery list to get deliveries that are done [âœ“].
   * Justification: This is a core feature of the product as drivers will be able to see the delivery tasks 
     they have completed and keep track of them.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability for drivers to get the list of uncompleted deliveries. (PR [\#60](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/60))
   * What it does: allows the user to filter the delivery list to get deliveries that are done [X].
   * Justification: This is a core feature of the product as it allows drivers to better view the delivery tasks
     that are not completed 
     
* **Edited Feature**: Edited the message shown in the HelpWindow (PR [\#117]( https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/117))
   * What it does: allows users to have a preview of all the commands and how to use them. If they need more examples, 
     the URL of the UserGuide is provided for them as well.
   * Justification: This is a core feature of the product as drivers can more conveniently see examples of the available commands
    offline instead of opening the browser to see the UserGuide.

* **Edited Feature**: Edited the GUI (PR [\#121]( https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/121))
    * What it does: Changes the GUI of the original AB3.
    * Justification: This is a necessary feature of the product to make it more appealing for drivers to use.
