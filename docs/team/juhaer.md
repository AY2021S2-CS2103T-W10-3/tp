## Project: TimeForWheels

TimeForWheels is an app for delivery drivers to manage their orders efficiently. It is optimized
for use via a Command Line Interface while still having the benefits of a Graphical User
Interface(GUI). Overall, TimeForWheels aims to increase work productivity for delivery drivers
by simplifying the delivery management and planning process.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
