### Project: TimeForWheels

TimeForWheels is a delivery task management app for delivery drivers to track and manage deliveries assigned to them.
It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) with the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
TimeForWheels aims to be your reliable delivery companion by simplifying the delivery administrative process and 
improving productivity.

Given below are my contributions to the project:
  
* **New Feature**: Added the ability for drivers to sort their delivery tasks in the delivery list. (PR [\#68](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/68))
  * What it does: allows the driver to get the sorted list of their delivery tasks, ranked first by completion status
    (incomplete then completed tasks), followed by urgency (tasks that have the urgent tag,
    only applicable for incomplete task), and lastly by date (deadline of delivery).
  * Justification: As drivers will constantly add more delivery tasks to their list, their list will be more 
    disorganised where their delivery tasks are arranged in random. Therefore, the sort function will help the drivers
    organise their delivery list where the delivery tasks are ranked from most urgent to least urgent to those 
    completed. This will allow the drivers to see which deliveries to prioritise and make first, easing their delivery
    administrative process.

* **Project management**:
  * Managed 4 releases `v1.1`-`v1.4` on GitHub

* **Enhancing existing features**:
  * Modified the existing Tag feature to only accept certain valid tag, which will enhance the relevancy of the tagging feature and its categorisation purpose (PR [\#66](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/66))
  * Modified the existing Help window to display our application's features in an order based on importance and relevancy. Enhanced the readability of the Help window as well (PR [\#120](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/120))
  * Refactored the entire code base (functional code, test code and json files) to match the context and theme of our project (PR [\#43](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/43)) and (PR [\#107](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/107))
  * Revamped the existing sample data (sample shown to new users) to match the context and theme of our project (PR [\#108](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/108))

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added the newly enhanced Tag feature with its description, usage, notes, examples and referencing images to the User Guide (PR [\#133](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/133))
    * Added the Sort feature with its description, usage, example and referencing images to the User Guide (PR [\#122](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/122))
    * Updated the User Guide to enhance its readability and consistency (PR [\#136](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/136))
    
   * Developer Guide:
     * Added all User Stories and Use Cases with their respective descriptions (PR [\#19](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/19))
     * Continued to update the Developer Guide based on changes in features (PR [\#45](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/45))
     * Added UML diagrams (Activity and Sequence) of Add, Clear and Sort features to the Developer Guide (PR [\#142](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/142))
  
* **Community**:
  * Gave advice for problems encountered by team members (PR [\#44](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/44))
